Have you ever found yourself wanting to connect more than one I2C device to a single controller and couldn't because they have identical I2C addresses? There you have it, I2C multiplexer (I2C MUX) allows you to use up to 8 devices with the same address on the same bus! If we mention that TCA9548A, the IC on which this breakout is based, has three adjustable pins for the I2C address, which means a total of 8 possible addresses. We can reach 64 devices with the same address on the same bus. For example, it is possible to connect 64 BME680 sensors that are read by only one microcontroller.




This adapter is particularly practical because it enables multiplexing of easyC devices.

## Repository contents

All Soldered Electronics hardware designed in KiCAD, and repositories are organized in the following way:

- CAD folder - contains KiCAD files (Schematics, Board, Panel Board), sorted by version. Change log lists all changes between versions.
- OUTPUTS - contains useful files, such as Bill of Materials (BOM), PDF of schematics, 3D .step file of the board and gerber files, sorted by version. 
- OUTPUTS -> Compliance - Certificates and useful legal stuff.
